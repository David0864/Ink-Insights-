## What Was Learned

Full-Stack Development : understanding how to develop a full-stack application using the MERN <br>
(MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, which covers both the front-end & back-end aspects of the application.

React : learned how to build interactive user interfaces & components using React, <br>
a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

GraphQL : implemented GraphQL for efficient data fetching & manipulation, allowing for flexible <br>
& optimized data queries in the application.

MongoDB & Mongoose : worked with MongoDB as the database & using Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) <br>
to interact with the database in a Node.js environment.

User Authentication : implemented authentication features using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure user data <br>
& restrict access to certain parts of the application.

Deployment : deployed the application using a platform like Render to make it accessible to users online.

UI Design : created a polished & responsive user interface that enhances the user experience <br>
& makes the application easy to navigate.

Collaboration : practiced teamwork & collaboration skills by working with a group to develop <br>
a complex project, including coordinating tasks, sharing code & resolving conflicts.

Problem-Solving : developed problem-solving skills by addressing real-world challenges <br>
faced during the development of the application & finding effective solutions.

Project Management : learned how to plan, organize & execute a project from start to finish, <br>
including defining requirements, setting milestones & managing timelines effectively.

Overall, this project provided a comprehensive learning experience that covers various aspects of <br>
full-stack application development, user experience design, collaboration & project management.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
